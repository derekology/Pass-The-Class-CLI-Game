# Pass The Class

Pass The Class is a command-line interface (CLI) game written in Python. It was created as a 4-week school project and is designed to simulate the experience of a student trying to pass their class. The game revolves around completing deliverables and passing a final exam.

Along the way, you can explore the game world to find lockers, and potentially discover valuable items like Reese's candies that restore energy, smarts, or luck. However, you can only obtain these items if you correctly guess the lock combination.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository locally using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/derekology/Pass-The-Class-CLI-Game.git
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your system.

3. Sync the package requirements by running the following command in the project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To start the game, run the following command:
```
python game.py
```

5. The game controls are as follows:
   - Use the **W** key to move **up**.
   - Use the **A** key to move **left**.
   - Use the **S** key to move **down**.
   - Use the **D** key to move **right**.
   - You may also need to input numbers at certain points in the game.

6. The game is best played in the PyCharm terminal due to its support for color codes. Note that the Windows 10 PowerShell or Command Prompt may not work as expected for this reason.

7. The game features a save game feature, allowing you to save your progress locally once completing a level.
