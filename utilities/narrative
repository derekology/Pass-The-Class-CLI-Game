Welcome to Pass the Class!
Your goal? To pass your class by completing all the assignments, quizzes, demos, hand-in templates, and the dreaded Final Exam (red ['E']).
Upon completing a deliverable, you may gain some much-deserved rewards. Whether you use it to stock up on chocolatey peanut butter goodness, feel a little smarter, or bank a lucky break is up to you.
Just don't study too hard, or you might run out of Reeses and pass out before the finish line.
Oh, and one more thing. Keep your eyes peeled for lockers (cyan ['L']) scattered throughout the map. If you manage to crack the combination, you could find even more rewards inside.
So, are you ready to put your skills to the test? Good luck!
